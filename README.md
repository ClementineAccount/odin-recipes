# Introduction

This project is an exercise for the open-source online course [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
This exercise in particular is focused only on using basic HTML to create a page hosting three recipies. I had chosen recipies themed after vikings in honor of the name of the course, since [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin) is a norse god.

## Recipies

The recipies I had chosen were taken from the following web page: 
- [10 Delicious Authentic Viking Recipes - Viking Warrior Shirts](https://www.vikingwarriorshirts.com/blogs/news/10-delicious-authentic-viking-recipes). 

# Requirements 

The project uses only HTML as per the [specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#introduction).

> The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, > that is.
>
> But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.


# Self-Reflection

24th July 2023: 

- I followed the instructions and completed the task in around two hours. Glad I didn't procrastinate and was able to break down the work in order to just get it done.
- Regarding atomic commits, I think I did okay for that. I made my commits often, used imperative mood and kept them small. I bet I'll get better at it with even more practice.
- I can't wait to go back and polish this project with CSS in the future. I like that I was able to apply the concepts taught. I also noticed I got better at creating the HTML boilerplate from memory as I practiced too, so I am glad I tried it by hand.
- One thing I noticed was that the source I used for the recipes, despite having a fancy javascript front-end framework, still had the lists in the same HTML tags I am familar with here. I am excitied to learn how that works as I progress through the course.
